1. **feasibility study**
 is conducted to evaluate a project's potential for success, determine the resources and costs involved, and support decision-making before development begins. It involves investigation and research to understand objectively the resources and costs involved, and weigh them against the value that will be attained following completion of the project or system. The study also assesses the return on investment (ROI) and only those projects and systems that return a reasonable ROI will be supported. The time spent in this stage depends on the size and complexity of the problem to be solved within the organization or business.

 2. **Requirements Engineering** stage of a system development process. It states that this stage aims to understand the business needs for the proposed system and involves business analysts eliciting, analyzing, documenting, and validating the requirements. The requirements are also managed throughout the development lifecycle to ensure they are accessible and changes can be managed. These requirements are used as input for the design stage, and it is important that the requirements can be traced from source to implementation throughout the development lifecycle. The amount of detail captured during this stage may be affected by the chosen development approach.

 3. **Desing** The design stage of the system development process involves evaluating possible solutions that meet the requirements and selecting the best one. The chosen design is then thoroughly detailed to guide the developers in implementing it.

4. **Development programming** The Development phase is where the technical components, including both hardware and software, are developed, acquired, or configured according to the design. The developers follow the design to ensure the system meets the needs of the business or customer.

5. **Testing** The Development phase is where the technical components, including both hardware and software, are developed, acquired, or configured according to the design. The developers follow the design to ensure the system meets the needs of the business or customer.

6. **Implementation** Before an IT system is ready to use it must be commissioned
into the ‘live’ or ‘operational’ environment. Up until this point in
a system’s development, a reference or test environment may
have been used in order to protect other systems from faults


## WHAT WE MEAN BY ‘SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT LIFECYCLE’

  There are a great many different system development lifecycles in use today. However,
they are underpinned by just five basic lifecycles and two approaches.  


1. **The Waterfall lifecycle** is the most basic of the lifecycles. It is a linear process that moves from one stage to the next in a sequential manner. The Waterfall lifecycle is often used for small projects and is the basis for many other lifecycles. It is also the basis for the 
2. **V-Model** lifecycle, which is a more detailed version of the Waterfall lifecycle. The V-Model lifecycle is used for larger projects. The bottom
of the ‘V’ is therefore the actual development that takes place to translate the project
definition into working software that can be verified and validated.
3. **Incremental** lifecycle is a variation of the Waterfall lifecycle. It is used for larger projects and is the basis for many other lifecycles.

## LIFECYCLES BASED ON THE EVOLUTIONARY APPROACH

The final two core lifecycles we will describe are evolutionary approaches. Evolutionary
approaches have been around since the 1980s and underpin the more popular ‘Agile’
approaches today. Although there are many processes and approaches that follow the
evolutionary approach, there are really only two fundamental lifecycles to explore –
they are:

1. **Iterative development** Iterative development is a lifecycle whereby the overall project is composed of several
small time-boxed developments, called iterations, which take place in sequence. 
2. **Spiral development** Spiral development is a lifecycle that is similar to iterative development, but it is more structured and has more stages. Spiral development is often used for larger projects.
